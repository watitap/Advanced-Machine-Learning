designing our own chips\\nand tightly integrating them\\nwith watchos unlocks innovative features\\nlike advanced workout metrics, sleep stages, and car crash\\ndetection. apple watch series 9 has been\\nredesigned on the inside with\\nthe all-new s9 sip, giving it a big boost\\nin performance and capabilities. it\\'s our most powerful watch\\nchip yet. the s9 cpu has 5.6 billion\\ntransistors, 60% more than series 8,\\nand its gpu is 30% faster. the new s9 chip makes the\\nanimations and effects in\\nwatchos 10 look super smooth. s9 also has a new 4-core neural\\nengine that can process machine\\nlearning tasks up to twice as\\nfast. this powerful custom silicon\\nis what allows us to maintain all-day 18-hour battery life while adding new features\\nand system-wide improvements to\\nseries 9. because it\\'s always on you, apple watch is often the easiest\\nand quickest way to use siri. to check the score,\\nclose the garage, or send a\\nmessage, just raise your wrist and ask.\\nit\\'s that simple. thanks to the powerful new\\nneural engine, siri requests are now processed\\non-device, making them faster and more\\nsecure. this means that the most common\\nrequests, like \"siri,\\nstart an outdoor walk workout,\" no longer have to go to the\\ncloud, so they can\\'t be slowed down\\nconnection.i-fi or cellula and because the neural engine\\ncan run a more advanced\\ntransformer model, dictation on series 9 is up to\\n25% more accurate than on series\\n8. secure on-device processing\\nalso enables a brand new\\nfeature: the ability to access\\nyour health data with siri. so now you can ask,\\n\"how much did i sleep last\\nnight?\", \"what\\'s my average walking heart\\nrate?\", or \"how does my move ring look\\ntoday?\" and you can log health data,\\nlike your weight or period, or that you\\'ve taken your\\nmedications, with just your\\nvoice. siri health queries will be\\navailable later this year in\\nenglish and mandarin with more languages to follow. apple watch is perfect for\\ninteracting with nearby objects\\nlike smart locks, gym equipment, or payment\\nterminals. at home or out in the world, your watch connects\\nto all kinds of devices making so many\\nof the things you do easier. and with watchos 10,\\nyou can use namedrop to instantly share\\nyour contact information with another person\\'s apple\\nwatch. this year, apple silicon\\nenhances another one of our users\\'\\nfavorite nearby or faraway\\nfeatures: the ability to ping your iphone. series 9 has a new\\nsecond-generation ultra wideband\\nchip that enables precision finding\\nfor iphones with the same chip. you\\'ll see both the distance\\nand direction to your iphone, and once you get close, haptic and audible feedback\\nguide you to its location, even if it\\'s in a different\\nroom. ultra wideband also brings new\\nintegration between apple watch\\nand homepod. when you get close to your\\nhomepod, media suggestions will\\nautomatically appear at the top\\nof the smart stack, so you can instantly fire up a\\nplaylist or podcast. or if audio is already playing, your watch will launch now\\nplaying to let you control it. series 9 features a big\\nedge-to-edge always-on retina\\ndisplay that\\'s even easier to read\\noutdoors because it now goes up to 2000\\nnits, double the brightness of\\nseries 8. the display is also better\\nin very dark situations, like a movie theater\\nor early morning wakeup, because it now goes down to just\\none nit. these features will be useful\\nevery time you put on

[excited chatter] ♪ ♪ jeff: as you can see, we\\'ve been working on some\\nreally big environmental\\ninitiatives and it\\'s making a difference. to share more, here\\'s lisa. ♪ ♪ lisa jackson: at apple, our\\nmission is to make products\\ncustomers love and protect the planet at the\\nsame time. three years ago,\\nwe made our corporate operations around the world carbon neutral. it was the first step towards our most ambitious\\nenvironmental commitment to\\ndate. apple 2030: our plan to be carbon neutral\\nacross our entire business by the year 2030. the next step is getting the\\ncarbon footprint of all of our\\nproducts down to net zero. for apple watch series 9,\\nwe challenged ourselves to significantly reduce\\ngreenhouse gas emissions from their three biggest\\nsources: materials, electricity,\\nand transportation. maximizing recycled\\nand renewable materials in our\\nproducts is key to apple 2030 because they have a lower carbon\\nimpact than virgin materials. so we use 100% recycled aluminum\\nin our watch cases, plus recycled gold, tin, copper,\\ntungsten, and more inside of\\nseries 9. and for the first time, there is\\n100% recycled cobalt in the\\nbattery. we also redesigned\\none of our most popular watch\\nbands, the sport loop,\\nto use more recycled material. it is now made with 82% recycled\\nyarn, while maintaining the softness\\nand comfort you love. electricity is the biggest\\nsource of carbon emissions. since 2015, we\\'ve been investing\\nin renewable energy like this solar installation\\nin central california while helping our suppliers do\\nthe same. and we\\'re excited to announce\\nthat starting this year, all apple watch manufacturing\\nis powered by 100% clean\\nelectricity, charging is another source of\\nemissions. while it\\'s a small amount per\\nperson, across millions of watch\\nwearers, it adds up. so we decided to do something\\nabout it. for series 9, apple will match\\n100% of your expected\\nelectricity use by investing in renewable energy\\nprojects around the world. finally, we looked at how apple\\nwatch gets from the factory to\\nyou. to cut emissions from\\ntransportation, we started by redesigning\\nseries 9 packaging to be 100%\\nfiber-based and more compact. it has a new, smaller shape that\\nlets us ship up to 25% more\\nwatches per trip. and more of those trips will be\\nmade with low-carbon shipping\\nmodes, like ocean-freight, which emits\\njust one-twentieth of shipping\\nby air. our efforts to reduce emissions\\nfrom materials, electricity, and\\ntransportation resulted in a whopping 78%\\ndecrease in the carbon\\nfootprint. the small amount of emissions\\nthat remain are offset by high-quality credits\\nfrom projects like forests and\\nwetlands that actively remove carbon\\nfrom the atmosphere. this last step brings the net\\ncarbon footprint of apple watch\\nseries 9 down to zero, making it our first-ever\\ncarbon neutral product! any combination of aluminum\\nseries 9 and new sport loop is\\ncarbon neutral and has been certified\\nby an independent third party. to help you recognize it,\\nyou\\'ll see this new logo on the\\nbox. we are so excited about this\\nachievement, and it\\'s how we plan to get all\\napple products to carbon\\nneutral, by innovating across design,\\nengineering, and operations to steeply reduce emissions before applying\\nhigh-quality carbon credits. while apple 2030 is the\\ndestination, the journey is\\nimportant, too. so we looked for additional\\nopportunities to make change. leather is a popular material\\nfor accessories, but it has a significant carbon\\nfootprint, especially at apple\\'s\\nscale. to reduce our impact, we will no\\nlonger use leather in any new\\napple products, including watch bands,\\nand that starts today. now, back to jeff to tell you\\nmore. jeff: we\\'ve developed a\\nbeautiful, luxurious, and\\ndurable new textile that we\\'re calling finewoven. it\\'s made of 68%\\npost-consumer recycled content, which has a significantly lower\\ncarbon footprint than leather. finewoven gives the new magnetic\\nlink a subtle luster and\\nsuede-like feel and it looks great\\non the modern buckle, too. both bands will be available in\\nnew colors and offer a sophisticated look\\nfor any special occasion. we also explored more\\nenvironmentally friendly\\nmaterials with our partners. this year, we collaborated with\\nhermès on four new styles that draw on\\ntheir long history in textiles. there are two elegant woven\\nbands, our first-ever knitted band,\\nand another in sporty molded\\nrubber. and all come in a range of rich\\ncolors. hermès radial, a modern take\\non their classic watch face, complements these innovative new\\nstyles. we also worked with nike\\nto design new bands that repurpose excess materials\\nand waste, reducing the use of virgin\\nmaterial. the new nike sport band includes\\ncolorful flakes of recycled\\nmaterial. they create a randomized pattern\\nthat makes each band unique. for the nike sport loop, we repurposed yarn from previous\\nseasons to make the same soft material\\nwith a fun, new space dye look. both bands come\\nin a range of dynamic colors. and there\\'s a new nike watch\\nface that shows each passing second\\non the lines of the globe. and that\\'s the new apple watch\\nseries 9. it features a magical new way\\nto control your watch with\\ndouble tap, faster on-device siri\\nthat lets you securely access\\nhealth data, precision finding for iphone, and a brighter display all enabled by the s9 sip, our most powerful chip ever\\nin an apple watch. and it\\'s apple\\'s first-ever\\ncarbon neutral product. now, let\\'s talk about

sometimes a call can\\'t go\\nthrough because you\\'re off the\\ngrid. when you need help in an\\nemergency, iphone introduced\\na breakthrough new service: emergency sos via satellite. it\\'s having an extraordinary\\nimpact, including helping first\\nresponders rescue people after accidents and natural\\ndisasters. and users have let their loved\\nones know that they\\'re safe, by updating their location\\nwith find my via satellite in places from the shetland\\nislands in scotland to mount wellington in tasmania. emergency sos and find my via\\nsatellite have expanded to 14 countries\\non three continents, and they\\'re coming to spain\\nand switzerland this month. emergency sos was built\\nfor serious emergencies that require a first responder. but say you have car trouble\\nand no cellular or wi-fi\\nservice. for those times, we\\'re\\nintroducing roadside assistance\\nvia satellite. it\\'s built on the same advanced\\ntechnology as our existing\\nsatellite service, and it\\'s so easy to use. just text roadside assistance and select what kind of help you\\nneed. then the intuitive interface\\nwill guide you to connect to a\\nsatellite and share that information\\nwith a roadside assistance\\nprovider. they\\'ll message you directly\\nand dispatch help to your exact\\nlocation, with the right equipment\\nto get you moving. it\\'s launching in the us with\\naaa, the country\\'s largest\\nroadside assistance provider. roadside service is covered\\nby aaa membership and is also available separately\\nfor non-members. this is yet another way\\nthat iphone is essential in our\\nlives. now, back to kaiann. kaiann: we\\'re thrilled to\\ninclude access to these\\nsatellite services free for two years with iphone\\n15. these best-in-class wireless\\ncapabilities keep you connected\\nwhen you\\'re on the go. now let\\'s talk about\\niphone\\'s wired capabilities. the connector is used for\\ncharging, syncing data,\\nor connecting to accessories. usb-c has become\\na universally accepted standard, so we\\'re bringing usb-c to\\niphone 15. it enables charging,\\ntransferring data, playing audio and video, and it\\'s been built\\ninto apple products for years. now, the same cable can charge\\nmac, ipad, iphone, and even airpods pro 2nd\\ngeneration which is updated with a usb-c\\nconnector. if your airpods are low on\\npower, you can charge them, or even an apple watch,\\nright from your iphone. we\\'re also bringing usb-c to\\nearpods, so they can work\\nwith iphone 15 seamlessly. and for an easy wireless\\nconnection to chargers and other\\naccessories, iphone 15 has magsafe, which uses magnets\\nwith 100% recycled rare earth\\nelements. these magnets ensure perfect\\nalignment of magsafe or qi2\\nchargers, as well as other accessories,\\nlike our beautiful cases and\\nwallets. millions of people use\\nthese magsafe accessories. and just like our watch bands, this gives us

here\\'s joz. ♪ ♪ greg \"joz\" joswiak: iphone 15\\npro is packed with\\nindustry-first innovations and features our users are going\\nto love. powered by our most advanced\\napple silicon yet, it delivers\\nthe most incredible photos and\\nvideos. and we are thrilled to introduce\\nour astonishing new titanium\\ndesign. this is the most premium\\nmaterial we\\'ve ever used in an\\niphone enclosure. titanium is incredibly strong\\nand durable. yet, at the same time, it is\\nmuch lighter, making these our lightest pro\\nmodels ever. you\\'ll feel it as soon as you\\npick it up. titanium is just beautiful. it feels fantastic\\nwith the new contoured edges, and we are also introducing the\\nthinnest borders ever on an\\niphone. this enabled us\\nto reduce iphone dimensions without affecting the display\\nsize. so together with the lighter\\nweight and new edges, iphone 15 pro\\nis a delight to hold in your\\nhand. in addition to the strength of\\ntitanium, iphone 15 pro has the toughest\\nglass-based materials in the\\nindustry, including the ceramic shield\\nfront, which is only available\\non iphone. and there are two great display\\nsizes to choose from: 6.1 inches for iphone 15 pro, and 6.7 inches for iphone 15 pro\\nmax. now, to tell you more\\nabout this incredible titanium\\ndesign, here\\'s isabel. isabel yang: every material we\\nchoose for iphone is\\nmeticulously considered. for iphone 15 pro we\\nre-evaluated every structural\\ncomponent, inside and out,\\noptimizing our alloy selection and creating a breakthrough\\ninnovation in manufacturing and\\nmaterials design. the new enclosure uses grade 5\\ntitanium, an alloy that has even higher\\ntensile strength than pure\\ntitanium. it\\'s typically reserved for\\napplications where the balance\\nof strength, formability, as well as weight,\\nare especially critical. in fact, this is the same alloy\\nused on the mars rover. titanium has one of the highest\\nstrength-to-weight ratios of any\\nmetal, providing incredible durability\\nfor iphone, while enabling a much lighter\\ndesign in comparison to\\nstainless steel. the titanium encases\\na new aluminum sub-structure that is bonded\\nusing solid-state diffusion. this is an industry-first\\ninnovation, using a new thermo-mechanical\\nprocess that joins these two metals\\nwith incredible high strength. using aluminum on the inside\\ncreates synergistic properties with the titanium enclosure, helping with thermal dissipation\\nand further weight reduction. titanium also introduces\\na new refined brush texture, enabled by a unique, multi-step\\nprocess that includes precision\\nmachining, sanding, brushing,\\nand blasting. and while anodizing is commonly\\nused on titanium, we chose to use a pvd coating as\\nadded protection while\\nintroducing color. these apple-designed coatings\\nare engineered with nanometer\\nprecision, and take up to 14 hours to\\ncomplete, resulting in four gorgeous\\nfinishes: black titanium and white\\ntitanium beautifully harmonize\\nwith the back glass, blue titanium highlights\\nthe material\\'s elegance, and natural titanium celebrates\\nits raw metallic nature. there is also\\na new internal chassis\\narchitecture that makes iphone more\\nrepairable, thanks to a new\\nstructural frame that allows the back glass\\nto be easily replaced. the entire aluminum\\nsub-structure is made with 100%\\nrecycled aluminum, a first for iphone, contributing to the overall\\nincrease in recycled materials as we work toward our 2030\\ngoals. now, back to joz. joz: there is another design\\nchange for iphone 15 pro that we\\'re really excited about. from the very first iphone, we\\'ve had the ring/silent\\nswitch, a quick and easy way\\nto mute iphone sounds. we wanted to make this even\\nbetter. so with iphone 15 pro,\\nwe are reinventing the\\nexperience with a customizable action\\nbutton. by default,\\nit\\'s still a simple ring/silent\\nswitch. to toggle between ring and\\nsilent, you simply press and hold the\\nbutton to confirm your intent. you also feel a distinctive\\nhaptic feedback for each state. and you can choose a set of\\nactions and easily switch\\nbetween them. for example, with a simple\\npress, you can start voice memos\\nto quickly record a new idea, or launch camera\\nto capture that important\\nmoment, activate a favorite\\naccessibility feature, like live\\nspeech, or you can use shortcuts\\nto open up an even wider set of\\noptions, from simply launching your\\nfavorite app to running your own\\ncustom shortcuts. the action button delivers\\neven more convenience and\\nversatility to the iphone experience. and every interaction gives you\\nvisual feedback with the dynamic\\nisland on the advanced pro display\\nof iphone 15 pro. in addition\\nto the innovative dynamic\\nisland, the super retina xdr display\\nalso provides the smooth\\nperformance of promotion, the brightness and color\\nof extreme dynamic range, and the convenience\\nof the always-on display. and with ios 17\\nwe\\'re introducing standby, a new full-screen experience activated by turning your iphone\\non its side while it\\'s charging. with the always-on display\\nof iphone 15 pro, standby stays on persistently\\nto show you useful information, perfect on a nightstand,\\nkitchen counter, or desk. you can choose a simple digital\\nclock, or customize your view\\nwith multiple widgets. iphone 15 pro also includes\\na huge advancement in\\nperformance. we are excited to introduce\\nnext-level performance and more pro capabilities than\\never with the a17 pro. for more on how this marks the\\nbeginning of a new chapter in\\niphone performance, here\\'s sri. ♪ ♪ sribalan santhanam: the a-series\\nchip powers every experience on\\niphone. for iphone 15 pro, we developed\\na new generation of apple\\nsilicon that is a major step forward,\\nwith changes throughout the\\nentire chip including a breakthrough new\\ngpu. at the foundation of this new\\nchip is the transistor\\ntechnology, and this is the industry\\'s first\\n3-nanometer chip. these 3-nanometer transistors\\nare patterned using state-of-the-art\\nextreme ultraviolet lithography. elements of these transistors\\nare just over 12 silicon atoms\\nwide. a17 pro features\\n19 billion of these transistors. and we use all of them\\nto improve the performance, efficiency, and features of our\\nnew chip. the new cpu features\\nmicro-architectural and design\\nimprovements for both our performance cores\\nand efficiency cores. our performance cores\\nare now up to 10% faster, continuing to deliver the\\nfastest single-threaded\\nperformance in any smartphone, challenging even high-end\\ndesktop pcs. our efficiency cores are also\\nfaster and remain unmatched in the\\nindustry, delivering three times the\\nperformance per watt of the\\ncompetition. these are critical to iphone as\\nyour most typical tasks run on\\nthese cores. the neural engine is now up to\\ntwice as fast for machine\\nlearning models, allowing it to process\\nup to 35 trillion operations per\\nsecond! the neural engine uses machine\\nlearning on device without sending your personal\\ndata to the cloud, powering features like\\ntyping more accurately with\\nautocorrect, lifting a subject from a photo\\nbackground, or creating a personal voice\\nfor users at risk of speech\\nloss. a17 pro has dedicated engines\\nthat enable pro features. those include the prores codec, and a display engine that powers\\npromotion and the always-on display. we also included a dedicated av1\\ndecoder, enabling more efficient\\nand high-quality video\\nexperiences for streaming services. iphone 15 pro also has\\nthe new usb-c connector, but for our pro models, we\\nincluded a new usb controller in\\na17 pro that enables new workflows\\nnot possible before. this is the first iphone\\nwith usb 3 speeds, up to 10 gigabits per second. using an optional usb 3 cable, that\\'s up to 20 times faster\\nthan usb 2, enabling much higher transfer\\nspeeds. the groundbreaking innovation\\nof a17 pro is a brand new gpu, with a new apple-designed\\nshader architecture, our biggest redesign\\nin the history of apple gpus. this is a pro-class gpu that\\nexpands what\\'s possible on\\niphone even more. we focused on three things: improving performance and\\nefficiency, running complex applications, and adding new rendering\\nfeatures. the new gpu is now a 6-core\\ndesign, which is up to 20% faster\\nfor peak performance. and we also focused on energy\\nefficiency that helps with sustained\\nperformance for games. we\\'ve added brand new features\\nto the gpu, like mesh shading, which lets games create detailed\\nenvironments while drawing less\\npower. and for the first time,\\nwe have hardware-accelerated ray\\ntracing, featuring the fastest\\nray-tracing performance in any\\nsmartphone. here\\'s a scene without ray\\ntracing that instead uses cube maps to\\napproximate the reflections on\\nsurfaces. the light reflecting in the\\nscene is less accurate and thus\\nless realistic. now here\\'s a scene\\nwith ray-traced reflections, more accurately representing\\nthe behavior of light and reflections of the\\nenvironment. with hardware-accelerated ray\\ntracing, a17 pro can run these graphics\\nsmoothly at much higher frame\\nrates than with software-based ray\\ntracing. it\\'s a more immersive experience\\nfor games and ar applications. a17 pro is more energy efficient\\nand can run up to four times\\nfaster when compared with\\nsoftware-based ray tracing on\\na16 bionic. gaming is further improved\\nwith new software features, including metalfx upscaling, which combines the performance\\nof the gpu and neural engine to enable high-quality graphics,\\nwhile using much less power. with the fastest chip ever\\non any smartphone, we are excited for iphone 15 pro\\nto change mobile gaming. back to joz to tell you more. joz: iphone is the best\\nmobile gaming platform in the\\nworld. iphone is powered

foundation\\nof hardware and software, it captures the most amazing\\nphotos and videos, with the incredible versatility\\nof multiple lenses. iphone 15 pro has\\nour best camera system yet. users will get even better\\nphotos and videos, powerful new features, and the\\nequivalent of seven camera\\nlenses in their pocket. to tell you how we achieve this,\\nhere\\'s misha. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ misha scepanovic: last year we\\nintroduced our innovative 48mp\\ncamera, which users loved for their\\nbeautiful high resolution\\nphotos. iphone 15 pro features a more\\nadvanced 48mp main camera, with an even larger sensor than\\niphone 15. the camera includes a new\\nnanoscale coating to reduce lens\\nflare, brings high resolution to\\neveryday photos, enables more focal lengths, and has better low-light\\nperformance for portraits and\\nnight mode. when using all pixels\\nof the quad-pixel sensor, the main camera can capture\\nunbelievable detail, like every little scale on this\\nlizard. in addition to 48mp proraw, users can now shoot in 48mp\\nheif, with four times more resolution\\nthan before. and with the power\\nof our computational\\nphotography, we have the new super-high\\nresolution default for the main\\ncamera. 24mp photos merge the best\\nof low light and detail\\ntogether, as you can see here\\nin the beautiful color of her\\neyes, the sharpness on the edges of\\nher clothes, and the artistic reflection on\\nthe table. since the new photonic engine\\nnow uses a 48mp image, iphone can shoot higher\\nresolution photos in 24-, 28- and 35-millimeter\\nfocal length, a very important range\\nfor pro photographers. they can now quickly switch\\nbetween these new options, and even choose a new default\\nlens, customizing their camera\\nexperience to their creative\\nneeds. iphone 15 pro also gets\\nnext-generation portraits with\\nfocus and depth control, with two times better\\nlow light performance, as you can see here\\nin this beautiful shot. the smallest details of her\\nexpression are incredibly clear and contrasted with the dimly\\nlit, yet detailed background. you can really feel her emotion. in this photo,\\nnight mode is unbelievable. now powered by the photonic\\nengine, we can capture more color\\nand details than ever, from the warmth of her lipstick to the creases of her white\\ndress. enabled by the lidar scanner, night mode portraits also look\\nstunning on iphone 15 pro. in this shot we captured\\nthe intricate fabric his sweater together with the beautiful\\nbokeh of the lights in the\\nbackground. and our latest smart hdr\\ndelivers even more true-to-life\\nphotos, with greater dynamic range. as you can see here\\nwith the beautiful lighting on\\nher face and the sun reflecting on her\\nhair, all while preserving the blue of\\nthe sky. now let\\'s talk about our zoom\\nrange. iphone 15 pro features\\na great 3x telephoto camera at 77-millimeter focal length, ideal for classic portraiture. for iphone 15 pro max, we are using the extra size\\nof the larger iphone to introduce something unique, our longest optical zoom yet, 5x optical zoom\\nat 120-millimeter focal length! we designed\\na state-of-the-art telephoto\\ncamera. compared to iphone 14 pro max, it has a 25% larger sensor, 100% focus pixels, and an f/2.8 aperture, the largest of any smartphone\\nat this optical range. 120 millimeter\\nis a very useful focal length, great for close-ups, wildlife photos, and getting closer to the sports\\naction. 120-millimeter lenses are\\ntypically long, so instead we created\\nan innovative tetra-prism\\ndesign, built right into iphone. the light rays are reflected\\nfour times through the glass\\nstructure, allowing the light to travel for\\nlonger in a much smaller design. this creates enough separation\\nbetween the lens and the sensor to enable the longer focal\\nlength. and we have our most advanced\\nstabilization yet: a combined ois and autofocus\\n3d sensor-shift module that moves in all three\\ndirections, a first for any\\nsmartphone. this was critical\\nto support the tetra-prism\\ndesign. it provides even better\\nstabilization, with up to 10,000\\nmicro-adjustments per second! that\\'s twice as many as iphone\\n14 pro. this longer focal length gives\\npro users a brand new creative\\noption, and we can\\'t wait to see\\nthe incredible photos they will\\ntake. the ultra wide camera is also\\nimproved with a new\\nanti-reflective coating, better night mode,\\nand the latest smart hdr, in addition to enabling one of\\nour users\\' favorite features on\\nthe pro models: macro photography. macro is one of the seven lenses\\nof the new pro camera system, with a 10x optical zoom range\\ngoing from 13- to 120-millimeter\\nfocal length, making iphone 15 pro max more\\npowerful and more versatile than\\never. now, back to joz. joz:\\niphone 15 pro will enable great\\nworkflows for photographers and filmmakers\\nthat previously weren\\'t\\npossible. using a usb 3 cable with iphone\\n15 pro enables incredibly fast\\ntransfer speeds. so it\\'s much faster\\nto transfer your large proraw\\nphotos or prores videos to your mac. and now you can use your iphone\\nwith capture one to shoot and instantly transfer\\n48mp proraw directly to a mac, easily creating a pro studio\\nsuited for today\\'s fast-paced\\nneeds. iphone 15 pro also supports\\nrecording prores video directly to an external storage\\ndrive. video productions can quickly\\nswap drives and keep iphone as\\nthe main camera on set. recording to an external drive\\nenables even higher quality\\nrecording options, pushing prores 4k up to 60\\nframes per second for the first\\ntime, a great option for filmmakers\\nto create cinematic slow motion. we are also introducing log\\nencoding to make prores even more\\npowerful for our pro users, enabling more range and\\nflexibility for visual effects and color grading in\\npost-production. with log encoding, iphone 15 pro\\nwill be the first smartphone in\\nthe world to support\\nthe academy color encoding\\nsystem, or aces,\\na global standard for color\\nworkflows, making it easier for filmmakers\\nto use iphone in their\\nproduction. the iphone 15 pro camera system\\npushes the limits of what you can capture with a\\nsmartphone. the precious
